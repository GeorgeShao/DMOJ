# DMOJ
My DMOJ solutions are here - some in Java, some in Python, some in both. <br/>
Almost all are completed & fully working solutions.<br/>
Solutions which are not fully working are marked so in comments at the top of the file with the comment text "NOT WORKING"<br/>

## Warning
Please do not copy & paste these solutions into DMOJ. It is against the rules and therefore a bannable offense.

## Usage
This section will show you how to run the files in this repository. It is highly recommended you read this, especially if you are a beginner in Java.

We will be using the files **CCC_19_J1.java** and **CCC_19_J1.py** as an example below.

### Java
First compile the .java files using the command ```javac CCC_19_J1.java```<br/>
Then run the file using the command ```java CCC_19_J1```
### Python
Run the file using the command ```python CCC_19_J1.py```
